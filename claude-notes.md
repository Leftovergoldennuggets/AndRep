# Claude Code Session Notes

## Current Status: Fixed intro story UI

### Intro Story Improvement

#### Problem:
- Yellow title and white subtitle on each story slide were cluttering the interface
- Made the story slides feel less smooth and more text-heavy
- Reduced visual focus on the story illustrations

#### Solution:
Removed title and subtitle elements from story slides:
- Removed yellow title text (large heading)
- Removed white subtitle text (smaller heading)
- Kept chapter indicator and story text for context
- Updated image alt text to be more generic
- Cleaned up STORY_SLIDES data structure by removing unused title/subtitle fields

#### Changes Made:
1. **FlappyBirdGame.tsx**:
   - Removed title and subtitle rendering sections
   - Updated image alt text to use chapter number instead of title/subtitle
   - Cleaned up STORY_SLIDES array to remove title and subtitle fields
   - Removed panel 5 (unnecessary final slide)
   - Removed "Keep running, rebel rooster! The prison never ends!" text
   - Updated all panel text to be more concise and impactful
   - Rewrote panel 4 to better set up the prison escape theme
   
#### Result:
- Cleaner, more focused story slides
- Better visual emphasis on story illustrations
- Smoother reading experience
- Less text clutter on screen
- Shorter, more concise story flow (4 panels instead of 5)
- Removed distracting footer text
- More concise and punchy storytelling
- Better transition from story to gameplay with escape theme

## Previous Status: Fixed responsive display issues

### Responsive Display Fix

#### Problem:
- Game canvas not scaling properly on different screen sizes
- Some users couldn't see the whole screen when playing online
- Fixed canvas size (1200x800) not adapting to viewport

#### Solution:
Implemented dynamic canvas scaling with aspect ratio preservation:
- Added containerRef, canvasScale, and canvasPosition state
- Created handleResize function that calculates proper scaling
- Updated canvas rendering to use absolute positioning with dynamic scaling
- Fixed CSS for proper fullscreen behavior in root components

#### Changes Made:
1. **FlappyBirdGame.tsx**:
   - Added window resize event handler
   - Dynamic scaling calculation based on container dimensions
   - Canvas positioned absolutely with calculated scale and position
   
2. **src/index.css**:
   - Added proper fullscreen CSS for html, body, and #root
   - Ensured all containers take full available space
   
3. **src/routes/__root.tsx**:
   - Updated root container to use h-screen with overflow hidden

#### Testing Completed:
- Mobile screen (375x667) - Working properly
- Tablet screen (768x1024) - Working properly  
- Desktop screen (1920x1080) - Working properly
- Medium desktop (1366x768) - Working properly

#### Commits:
- fix: add responsive canvas scaling for proper display on all screen sizes
- fix: separate UI overlays from canvas scaling to ensure buttons remain visible

#### Final Status:
Reverted to db867d9 - the version where the story screen requires scrolling but the game displays properly scaled. This version maintains:
- Dynamic canvas scaling with proper aspect ratio
- UI overlays positioned independently from canvas
- Story screen with scrollable content (buttons may require scrolling on smaller screens)
- Game properly centered and scaled on all screen sizes

## Previous Status: Making game easier based on player feedback

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Physics & Movement (constants.ts)

- **Berserker Mode Duration**: 5000ms → 7000ms
- **Berserker Mode Damage**: 2x → 3x

#### 5. Weapons (weapons.ts & FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
All weapons received significant buffs:
- **Damage**: ~2x increase across all weapons
- **Fire Rate**: 25-50% faster
- **Ammo**: 2x increase
- **Accuracy**: Improved (reduced spread)
- **Range**: Increased by 20-25%

#### 6. Level & Boss Configuration (config.ts)
- **Enemy Density**: 0.02 → 0.01 (50% fewer enemies)
- **Obstacle Density**: 0.03 → 0.02 (fewer obstacles)
- **Powerup Density**: 0.01 → 0.02 (more powerups)
- **Boss Health**: All bosses reduced by 50%
  - Warden: 300 → 150
  - Captain: 400 → 200
  - Chief: 500 → 250
  - Helicopter: 600 → 300
- **Boss Speed**: Reduced by 30-40%

#### 7. Enemy Stats (FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
- **Enemy Health**: 60 → 30 (die in fewer hits)
- **Enemy Fire Rate**: 1500ms → 2500ms (shoot less often)
- **Bullet Size**: 9 → 12 (bigger hitboxes)

### Code Refactoring Progress:

#### Phase 1: Core Systems Extraction (Completed)
- **physics.ts**: Extracted collision detection, gravity, and physics utilities
- **gameState.ts**: Extracted game state initialization and level generation
- **playerActions.ts**: Extracted all player control functions (jump, shoot, dash, etc.)
- **inputHandlers.ts**: Extracted keyboard and mouse event handling
- **rendering.ts**: Extracted basic rendering functions for all game entities

#### Phase 2: File Size Reduction Impact
- Created 5 new focused modules (~300 lines each)
- Extracted ~1,500+ lines from main FlappyBirdGame.tsx
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns

#### Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup (Completed)
- **Removed unused levels**: Cleaned up 3 unused levels (2-4), keeping only Prison Yard
- **Removed unused bosses**: Removed captain, chief, helicopter configurations
- **Streamlined weapons**: Removed sniper, machinegun; kept pistol, shotgun, rifle, grenade
- **Simplified types**: Updated all type definitions to match actual usage
- **Removed duplicate files**: Deleted FlappyBirdGameRefactored.tsx and backup files
- **Cleaned configurations**: Removed unused theme backgrounds and boss configs

### Difficulty Rebalancing (After "Too Easy" Feedback):

#### Balanced Adjustments Made:
- **Boss Health**: 150 → 250 (requires multiple hits but not a damage sponge)
- **Enemy Health**: 30 → 45 (more durable but still reasonable)
- **Player Health**: 20 → 15 (still improved from original 10)
- **Weapon Damage**: Reduced to moderate levels (~25% increase from original vs 100%)
  - Pistol: 40 → 25 damage
  - Rifle: 70 → 45 damage  
  - Shotgun: 30 → 20 damage per pellet
  - Grenade: 150 → 80 damage (powerful but not one-shot boss)
- **Fire Rates**: Still improved but not overpowered
- **Enemy Fire Rate**: 2500ms → 2000ms (moderate shooting frequency)

#### Result: Challenging but Fair
- Boss requires ~4-6 rifle shots or ~10-12 pistol shots
- Enemies take 2-3 hits with most weapons
- Player can still take more damage than original
- Maintains quality-of-life improvements without trivializing combat

### Boss Phase Balance Fix (After "Berserker Mode" Feedback):

#### Problem Identified:
- **Normal phase too easy**: Boss wasn't threatening enough early on
- **Berserker mode too hard**: Became "unstoppable" with 200ms fire rate + 6 speed + chaotic bullets
- **Inconsistent difficulty**: Massive spike at 30% health made fight unpredictable

#### Balanced Solution:
- **Consistent challenge**: Made normal phase more threatening from the start
- **Removed overpowered berserker**: Eliminated the separate 200ms fire rate berserker mode
- **Smooth scaling**: Rage mode now triggers at 40% health with moderate increases
- **Better patterns**: More consistent bullet patterns, less chaotic spread
- **Fire rates**: Normal 300ms → Rage 350ms (vs old Normal 400ms → Berserker 200ms)
- **Movement**: Consistent 5 speed throughout (vs old Normal 4 → Berserker 6)
- **Health**: Increased to 280 to account for more consistent difficulty curve

#### Result: Consistent Challenge
- Boss is threatening from start to finish
- No more "unstoppable" phase that requires perfect play
- Rage mode provides escalation without becoming unfair
- Fight length is appropriate (~6-8 rifle shots or ~11-14 pistol shots)

### Boss Visual Enhancement:

#### Problem:
- Boss was rendered as a simple purple rectangle (90x90 pixels)
- Didn't match the game's pixelated prison guard aesthetic
- Lacked visual distinction and character

#### Solution:
Created detailed boss sprite for Corrupt Warden:
- **Body**: Dark blue prison warden uniform (#1a237e)
- **Hat**: Police/warden cap with gold badge
- **Features**: Menacing eyes (red in rage mode), angry eyebrows, mustache
- **Equipment**: Shotgun, ammo belt with shells
- **Badge**: Gold star on chest
- **Rage Mode**: Red aura effect when phase > 1

#### Visual Elements:
- Matches pixel art style of story panels
- Clear prison warden identity
- Visual feedback for rage mode
- Direction-aware weapon positioning
- Detailed but readable at game scale

### Next Steps:
- Test and validate the consistent boss difficulty
- Consider adding difficulty settings (Easy/Normal/Hard) for future updates
