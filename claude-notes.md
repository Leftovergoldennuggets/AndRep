# Claude Code Session Notes

## Current Status: Making game easier based on player feedback

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Physics & Movement (constants.ts)
- **Gravity**: 0.6 → 0.4 (slower falling, easier control)
- **Jump Force**: -12 → -14 (higher jumps)
- **Player Speed**: 5 → 7 (faster movement)
- **Bullet Speed**: 15 → 20 (easier to hit enemies)
- **Enemy Bullet Speed**: 8 → 5 (easier to dodge)

#### 2. Player Stats (constants.ts & FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
- **Max Health**: 100 → 150 (constants.ts), 10 → 20 (main file)
- **Spawn Immunity**: 2000ms → 3000ms (longer protection)

#### 3. Enemy AI (constants.ts)
- **Patrol Speed**: 1 → 0.5 (slower enemies)
- **Chase Speed**: 2 → 1.5 (slower chasing)
- **Detection Range**: 300 → 200 (shorter detection)
- **Attack Range**: 400 → 300 (closer attack range)
- **Alert Decay**: 1 → 2 (lose alert faster)

#### 4. Special Abilities (constants.ts & FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
- **Multi-shot Cooldown**: 4000ms → 2000ms
- **Multi-shot Bullets**: 3 → 5
- **Execution Dash Cooldown**: 6000ms → 3000ms
- **Execution Dash Distance**: 300 → 400
- **Execution Dash Damage**: 50 → 100
- **Berserker Mode Cooldown**: 8000ms → 5000ms
- **Berserker Mode Duration**: 5000ms → 7000ms
- **Berserker Mode Damage**: 2x → 3x

#### 5. Weapons (weapons.ts & FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
All weapons received significant buffs:
- **Damage**: ~2x increase across all weapons
- **Fire Rate**: 25-50% faster
- **Ammo**: 2x increase
- **Accuracy**: Improved (reduced spread)
- **Range**: Increased by 20-25%

#### 6. Level & Boss Configuration (config.ts)
- **Enemy Density**: 0.02 → 0.01 (50% fewer enemies)
- **Obstacle Density**: 0.03 → 0.02 (fewer obstacles)
- **Powerup Density**: 0.01 → 0.02 (more powerups)
- **Boss Health**: All bosses reduced by 50%
  - Warden: 300 → 150
  - Captain: 400 → 200
  - Chief: 500 → 250
  - Helicopter: 600 → 300
- **Boss Speed**: Reduced by 30-40%

#### 7. Enemy Stats (FlappyBirdGame.tsx)
- **Enemy Health**: 60 → 30 (die in fewer hits)
- **Enemy Fire Rate**: 1500ms → 2500ms (shoot less often)
- **Bullet Size**: 9 → 12 (bigger hitboxes)

### Code Refactoring Progress:

#### Phase 1: Core Systems Extraction (Completed)
- **physics.ts**: Extracted collision detection, gravity, and physics utilities
- **gameState.ts**: Extracted game state initialization and level generation
- **playerActions.ts**: Extracted all player control functions (jump, shoot, dash, etc.)
- **inputHandlers.ts**: Extracted keyboard and mouse event handling
- **rendering.ts**: Extracted basic rendering functions for all game entities

#### Phase 2: File Size Reduction Impact
- Created 5 new focused modules (~300 lines each)
- Extracted ~1,500+ lines from main FlappyBirdGame.tsx
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns

#### Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup (Completed)
- **Removed unused levels**: Cleaned up 3 unused levels (2-4), keeping only Prison Yard
- **Removed unused bosses**: Removed captain, chief, helicopter configurations
- **Streamlined weapons**: Removed sniper, machinegun; kept pistol, shotgun, rifle, grenade
- **Simplified types**: Updated all type definitions to match actual usage
- **Removed duplicate files**: Deleted FlappyBirdGameRefactored.tsx and backup files
- **Cleaned configurations**: Removed unused theme backgrounds and boss configs

### Difficulty Rebalancing (After "Too Easy" Feedback):

#### Balanced Adjustments Made:
- **Boss Health**: 150 → 250 (requires multiple hits but not a damage sponge)
- **Enemy Health**: 30 → 45 (more durable but still reasonable)
- **Player Health**: 20 → 15 (still improved from original 10)
- **Weapon Damage**: Reduced to moderate levels (~25% increase from original vs 100%)
  - Pistol: 40 → 25 damage
  - Rifle: 70 → 45 damage  
  - Shotgun: 30 → 20 damage per pellet
  - Grenade: 150 → 80 damage (powerful but not one-shot boss)
- **Fire Rates**: Still improved but not overpowered
- **Enemy Fire Rate**: 2500ms → 2000ms (moderate shooting frequency)

#### Result: Challenging but Fair
- Boss requires ~4-6 rifle shots or ~10-12 pistol shots
- Enemies take 2-3 hits with most weapons
- Player can still take more damage than original
- Maintains quality-of-life improvements without trivializing combat

### Next Steps:
- Test and validate the new balanced difficulty
- Consider adding difficulty settings (Easy/Normal/Hard) for future updates
