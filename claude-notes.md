- Reduced visual focus on the story illustrations

#### Solution:
Removed title and subtitle elements from story slides:
- Removed yellow title text (large heading)
- Removed white subtitle text (smaller heading)
- Kept chapter indicator and story text for context
- Updated image alt text to be more generic
- Cleaned up STORY_SLIDES data structure by removing unused title/subtitle fields

#### Changes Made:
1. **FlappyBirdGame.tsx**:
   - Removed title and subtitle rendering sections
   - Updated image alt text to use chapter number instead of title/subtitle
   - Cleaned up STORY_SLIDES array to remove title and subtitle fields
   - Removed panel 5 (unnecessary final slide)
   - Removed "Keep running, rebel rooster! The prison never ends!" text
   - Updated all panel text to be more concise and impactful
   - Rewrote panel 4 to better set up the prison escape theme

   - Updated `GAME_CONFIG.player.maxHealth` in FlappyBirdGame.tsx (was the main issue)
   - Fixed hardcoded max health value in rendering.ts health bar display
   - Makes the game more challenging and requires more careful gameplay

#### Result:
- More challenging gameplay requiring better tactics
- Players need to be more strategic about taking damage
- Balanced difficulty increase without being unfair
- Health bar now correctly displays 10 max health

### End Screens UI Improvement

#### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Yellow Title and White Subtitle**: Cleaned up both Game Over and Victory screens
   - Removed "GAME OVER" / "VICTORY" yellow titles
   - Removed "THE LEGEND ENDS" / "THE LEGEND LIVES ON" white subtitles

2. **Fixed Button Visibility**: Applied same responsive layout approach as intro panels
   - Updated both screens to use flex layout that prevents scrolling
   - Ensured Try Again and Continue buttons are always visible
   - Made button sizes responsive for all screen sizes
   - Used viewport-relative image sizing (max-h-[40vh] sm:max-h-[45vh])

#### Result:
- Cleaner, more focused end screens
- Better visual emphasis on the story illustrations  
- No more scrolling required to access buttons

   - Walking cycle with alternating foot stomping
   - Rage mode effects: glowing badges, red aura, electrical effects
   - Dust clouds during heavy stomping and charging
   - Motion blur and speed lines during rapid movement
   - Shadow casting and ground crack effects in rage mode

#### Enhanced Movement Patterns:
1. **Normal Phase - Tactical Behavior**:
   - **Advance Pattern**: Slow, menacing advance with stomping sound effects
   - **Retreat Pattern**: Tactical withdrawal while maintaining aim
   - Dynamic pattern switching based on distance and timing
   - Measured shotgun blasts with camera shake

2. **Rage Phase - Aggressive Assault** (triggers at 40% health):
   - **Charge Pattern**: Powerful charging attacks with dust trail particles
   - **Area Denial**: Rapid-fire bullet hell patterns with spread shots
   - Enhanced visual effects: electrical aura, speed lines, ground cracks
   - Dynamic behavior state system with pattern transitions

3. **Smart AI Features**:
   - Direction-aware pupil tracking and weapon positioning
   - Behavior state management with timing-based pattern switches

- 🔥 Muzzle flash during shooting
- 👢 Dynamic stomping with dust clouds
- 🌪️ Motion blur during high-speed movement
- ⚡ Speed lines during charging attacks
- 💀 Enhanced nameplate with "CORRUPT WARDEN JOHNSON"
- 🩸 Ground crack effects in rage mode

#### Problem Found:
- Enhanced boss rendering code was in `rendering.ts` but main game uses its own `drawEnemy` function
- User correctly observed "He looks exactly the same" because enhancements weren't actually being used

#### Solution - Integrated Enhanced Visuals:
Successfully integrated enhanced warden features into main game's existing boss rendering:

1. **Enhanced Animation System**:
   - **Movement-based effects**: `walkCycle` animation that intensifies with speed
   - **Blinking animation**: Realistic eye closing/opening every few seconds  
   - **Pupil tracking**: Eyes follow movement direction with `pupilOffset`
   - **Breathing with walking**: Head bobs slightly when moving

2. **Rage Mode Visual Enhancements**:
   - **Electrical aura**: Rotating lightning bolts around boss in rage mode
   - **Enhanced eye glow**: Pupils glow red and intensify during rage
   - **Red aura overlay**: Pulsing red glow effect over entire boss
   - **Dynamic rage pulse**: All effects intensify with `ragePulse` variable

3. **Movement Visual Effects**:
   - **Motion blur**: Trailing shadow effect when moving fast (`moveIntensity > 0.3`)
   - **Dust clouds**: Ground dust when moving at high speed (`moveIntensity > 0.5`)
   - **Speed lines**: Dynamic trailing lines during charge attacks
   - **Directional effects**: All effects respect movement direction

4. **Enhanced Responsiveness**:
   - All animations tied to actual boss behavior state and movement
   - Rage mode effects only appear when `enemy.phase > 1` 
   - Charging effects only during charge behavior pattern
   - Intensity scales with actual movement speed

#### Result:
- **Visually Impressive**: Boss now has detailed dynamic animations that respond to behavior
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for rage mode, movement, and attack patterns  
- **Smooth Animations**: Breathing, blinking, walking, pupil tracking all work together
- **Better Combat Feel**: Player can see boss's state and intentions through visual cues
- **Integrated Successfully**: Enhanced visuals now appear in actual gameplay, not just in unused code

### Latest Enhancement: Pixel Art Warden Design

#### Problem:
- User requested pixel art style to match the guards instead of organic/smooth rendering
- Original enhanced warden used ellipses and curves which didn't fit the game's pixel aesthetic

#### Solution - Complete Pixel Art Redesign:
Completely redesigned the corrupt warden boss using pixel-perfect rectangles and squares:

1. **Pixel Art Head & Face**:
   - **Dynamic pixel scaling**: `pixelSize` based on boss size for consistent pixel look
   - **Skin tone blocks**: Weathered prison guard complexion with proper shading
   - **Animated pixel eyes**: Blinking animation with pupil tracking using pixel offsets
   - **Facial scars**: Diagonal and vertical pixel scars for battle-hardened look
   - **Angry eyebrows**: Sharp angular pixel eyebrows

2. **Prison Warden Uniform**:
   - **Dark blue uniform**: Official prison warden colors (#1a237e)
   - **Gold buttons**: 5 precise pixel buttons down the front
   - **Shoulder epaulettes**: Rank insignia with gold stripes on sleeves
   - **Chest badge**: Pixel art sheriff star with skull symbol
   - **Belt and buckle**: Tactical belt with gold rectangular buckle

3. **Warden Cap & Badge**:
   - **Official cap**: Multi-layer pixel design with visor
   - **Cap badge**: Prison warden star with skull details
   - **Proper proportions**: Scaled to boss size maintaining pixel precision

4. **Detailed Equipment**:
   - **Pixel shotgun**: Detailed weapon with stock, barrel, and grip
   - **Prison keys**: Jangling key ring with movement animation
   - **Combat boots**: Heavy duty boots with laces and stomping animation
   - **Muscular arms**: Skin-toned arms with proper pixel shading

5. **Enhanced Pixel Animations**:
   - **Walking cycle**: Pixel-perfect leg alternation during movement
   - **Breathing**: Subtle pixel position shifts for life-like effect
   - **Blinking**: Eyes close to single pixel height periodically
   - **Pupil tracking**: Eyes follow movement direction with pixel precision
   - **Muzzle flash**: Pixel-based shotgun flash effects

6. **Rage Mode Pixel Effects**:
   - **Eye glow**: Red pixel overlay during rage mode
   - **Electrical aura**: Pixel-based lightning effects
   - **Enhanced animations**: All effects maintain pixel art aesthetic

#### Technical Implementation:
- Used `Math.floor()` on all animation offsets to maintain pixel boundaries
- Dynamic `pixelSize` calculation: `Math.max(1, Math.floor(bossSize / 45))`
- All shapes drawn with `ctx.fillRect()` for perfect pixel edges
- Color palette designed to match existing guard pixel art
- Maintained all existing behavior-based animations in pixel form

#### Result:
- **Perfect Pixel Art**: Boss now matches the game's pixel aesthetic completely
- **Detailed Design**: Much more detailed than original simple rectangle
- **Consistent Style**: Matches guard pixel art but with boss-level detail and size
- **Smooth Animations**: All animations work with pixel-perfect precision
- **Enhanced Presence**: Intimidating prison warden design that fits the prison theme
- **Maintained Functionality**: All rage mode and movement effects preserved in pixel form

## Previous Status: Fixed responsive display issues

### Responsive Display Fix

#### Problem:
- Game canvas not scaling properly on different screen sizes
- Some users couldn't see the whole screen when playing online
- Fixed canvas size (1200x800) not adapting to viewport

#### Solution:
Implemented dynamic canvas scaling with aspect ratio preservation:
- Added containerRef, canvasScale, and canvasPosition state
- Created handleResize function that calculates proper scaling
- Updated canvas rendering to use absolute positioning with dynamic scaling
- Fixed CSS for proper fullscreen behavior in root components

#### Changes Made:
1. **FlappyBirdGame.tsx**:
   - Added window resize event handler
   - Dynamic scaling calculation based on container dimensions
   - Canvas positioned absolutely with calculated scale and position
   
2. **src/index.css**:
   - Added proper fullscreen CSS for html, body, and #root
   - Ensured all containers take full available space
   
3. **src/routes/__root.tsx**:
   - Updated root container to use h-screen with overflow hidden

#### Testing Completed:
- Mobile screen (375x667) - Working properly
- Tablet screen (768x1024) - Working properly  
- Desktop screen (1920x1080) - Working properly
- Medium desktop (1366x768) - Working properly

#### Commits:
- fix: add responsive canvas scaling for proper display on all screen sizes
- fix: separate UI overlays from canvas scaling to ensure buttons remain visible

#### Final Status:
Reverted to db867d9 - the version where the story screen requires scrolling but the game displays properly scaled. This version maintains:
- Dynamic canvas scaling with proper aspect ratio
- UI overlays positioned independently from canvas
- Story screen with scrollable content (buttons may require scrolling on smaller screens)
- Game properly centered and scaled on all screen sizes

- **Streamlined weapons**: Removed sniper, machinegun; kept pistol, shotgun, rifle, grenade
- **Simplified types**: Updated all type definitions to match actual usage
- **Removed duplicate files**: Deleted FlappyBirdGameRefactored.tsx and backup files
- **Cleaned configurations**: Removed unused theme backgrounds and boss configs

### Difficulty Rebalancing (After "Too Easy" Feedback):

#### Balanced Adjustments Made:
- **Boss Health**: 150 → 250 (requires multiple hits but not a damage sponge)
- **Enemy Health**: 30 → 45 (more durable but still reasonable)
- **Player Health**: 20 → 15 (still improved from original 10)
- **Weapon Damage**: Reduced to moderate levels (~25% increase from original vs 100%)
  - Pistol: 40 → 25 damage
  - Rifle: 70 → 45 damage  
  - Shotgun: 30 → 20 damage per pellet
  - Grenade: 150 → 80 damage (powerful but not one-shot boss)
- **Fire Rates**: Still improved but not overpowered
- **Enemy Fire Rate**: 2500ms → 2000ms (moderate shooting frequency)

#### Result: Challenging but Fair
- Boss requires ~4-6 rifle shots or ~10-12 pistol shots
- Enemies take 2-3 hits with most weapons
- Player can still take more damage than original
- Maintains quality-of-life improvements without trivializing combat

### Boss Phase Balance Fix (After "Berserker Mode" Feedback):

#### Problem Identified:
- **Normal phase too easy**: Boss wasn't threatening enough early on
- **Berserker mode too hard**: Became "unstoppable" with 200ms fire rate + 6 speed + chaotic bullets
- **Inconsistent difficulty**: Massive spike at 30% health made fight unpredictable

#### Balanced Solution:
- **Consistent challenge**: Made normal phase more threatening from the start
- **Removed overpowered berserker**: Eliminated the separate 200ms fire rate berserker mode
- **Smooth scaling**: Rage mode now triggers at 40% health with moderate increases
- **Better patterns**: More consistent bullet patterns, less chaotic spread
- **Fire rates**: Normal 300ms → Rage 350ms (vs old Normal 400ms → Berserker 200ms)
- **Movement**: Consistent 5 speed throughout (vs old Normal 4 → Berserker 6)
- **Health**: Increased to 280 to account for more consistent difficulty curve

#### Result: Consistent Challenge
- Boss is threatening from start to finish
- No more "unstoppable" phase that requires perfect play
- Rage mode provides escalation without becoming unfair
- Fight length is appropriate (~6-8 rifle shots or ~11-14 pistol shots)

### Boss Visual Enhancement:

#### Problem:
- Boss was rendered as a simple purple rectangle (90x90 pixels)
- Didn't match the game's pixelated prison guard aesthetic
- Lacked visual distinction and character

#### Solution:
Created detailed boss sprite for Corrupt Warden:
- **Body**: Dark blue prison warden uniform (#1a237e)
- **Hat**: Police/warden cap with gold badge
- **Features**: Menacing eyes (red in rage mode), angry eyebrows, mustache
- **Equipment**: Shotgun, ammo belt with shells
- **Badge**: Gold star on chest
- **Rage Mode**: Red aura effect when phase > 1

#### Visual Elements:
- Matches pixel art style of story panels
- Clear prison warden identity
- Visual feedback for rage mode
- Direction-aware weapon positioning
- Detailed but readable at game scale

### Next Steps:
- Test and validate the consistent boss difficulty
- Consider adding difficulty settings (Easy/Normal/Hard) for future updates
