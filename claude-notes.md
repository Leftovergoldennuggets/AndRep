## Important Context
- This is a template repository being initialized into a new application
- Using project:init-app command workflow
- Need to reread project:init-app command content if starting from fresh session

## Tech Stack
- Full-stack TypeScript: React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend)
- Convex (backend), Clerk (auth)
- Tailwind CSS 4, daisyUI 5
